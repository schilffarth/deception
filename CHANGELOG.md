### Update pre-release

#### Based on WMG-feedback

- Added more "love" to the first scenario's map, to make the "endless sand" more interesting
- Changed scenario 1's goblin forces to spawn periodically instead of all at once in the start (reduced initial amount of enemies, increased total count of enemies throughout turns 1 - 7)
- Changed scenario 02 Ascent to Power objective from 3 to 2 leaders killed, to decrease time required to progress the story
