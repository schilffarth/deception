todos:

- Finish scenario 03 (04b should be inaccessible for now)
- Generally make the "difficulty" scale from 1 - 4 - 10
- Make scenario 1 be more of an "xp-grind" to arm for scenario 2
- Make scenario 2 more "winnable", with the updated map + second goal (either kill leaders or reach the stronghold)
- Add "limited" shamans to scenario 02, maybe hidden in forest or locked in cages?
- Maybe the shamans could provide dark magic influences?
- Blood magic stronger + the returned damage capped at 1
