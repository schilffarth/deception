# Deception

This add-on is separated into 2 campaigns. Part 1 guides the player through Kalgor's character development from an innocent orc child, to an evil and corrupted ruler, shaping the antagonist for Part 2. In Part 2, direct the fate of Durok, a humble orcish farmer, whose tribe has been slaughtered by Kalgor.
Part 2 allows player-driven choices to significantly influence or even completely redirect the story development, offering an incredible factor of replayability.

## Deception Part 1

Embark on a journey with Kalgor, whose world is shattered with his father's murder in front of his eyes. Forged in the crucible of battle, betrayal and deception, his fate sparks with glory and tragedy, shaping the antagonist of <b>Deception Part 2</b>.

(Intermediate level, 7 scenarios.)

## Deception Part 2

Part 2 of Deception is not recommended to be played yet, although scenarios 1 and 2 <i>can</i> be played. I do not seek any feedback for Part 2 of Deception just yet.

(Intermediate level, 2/10 scenarios finished.)

Completely done by myself. For those interested in the story only, feel free to check out the story Word documents in the add-on's `story/` directory.
