            story= _ "The morning found Kalgor in the cold grip of unease. Jolted awake from a harrowing dream, his breath came out in ragged gasps as a chill sweat soaked his brow. He sat upright on his makeshift bed, his gaze riveted on the spectral shadow that was slowly drawing away from him. It crawled eerily, shapeless and silent, over the rough-textured canvas of his dwelling."

        [part]
            background=108_tent.png
            story= _ "The shadow lingered on the fringes, ominous and foreboding, before melting into the fortified walls of his tent. As it dissipated, a chill crept up his spine. This wasn't an ordinary morning dread; the nightmare's terror hadn't faded with wakefulness. Instead, it had cemented into a haunting realization - his nightmares were not simply figments of a troubled sleep but harbingers of the reality that held him in its thrall, the grim puppetry enacted by Voldur."

            background=104_evil.png
            story= _ "Kalgor found himself grappling with his past. His thoughts roamed the vast expanse of his life, from the innocent days of his childhood spent in the arid wastes of Wesnoth to his early adulthood laced with a burning thirst for power and revenge. Each memory painted a vivid picture, each a thread intricately woven into the tapestry of his life, marked by the cruel hand of fate."

            background=104_evil.png
            story= _ "The journey, riddled with triumphs and losses, had led him down a path he had not foreseen. His yearning for power had drawn him into the dark allure of the arcane, right into Voldur's deceptive mentorship. The once aspiring orc was now a puppet, his life manipulated, his destiny warped by the arcane master's strings. This moment of reckoning weighed heavy on him, a stern reminder of his inescapable predicament."

        [part]
            background=108_orcs.png
            story= _ "A sense of urgency gripped him as he pondered his next move. His decision was born out of desperation and resilience â€“ to confront his puppeteer. He had resolved to march south, to the forest that mirrored his nightmares, to challenge Voldur. The course of his life was to be redirected by this confrontation; a futile attempt to break free from his puppeteer's shackles."

            story= _ "His declaration reverberated through the silence, the very walls of his tent appearing to vibrate at the resonance of his resolve. The shadow, which had been quietly absorbed into the background, flickered as if in response. It shimmered briefly, oscillating between visibility and obscurity, as if anticipating the clash of powers that was imminent."

            story= _ "Their journey commenced under an overcast sky, leading them towards the welcoming edges of the forest. For the first few hours, the forest was a pristine haven, a riot of green as far as the eye could see. The dense canopy overhead was like a vibrant patchwork quilt, woven with countless hues of green. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor. The air was fresh and invigorating, filled with the chirping of birds and the rustling of leaves."

            background=108_dark_forest.png
            story= _ "However, as they ventured deeper into the heart of the forest, it was as if they were traversing an uncanny threshold, crossing over into a realm of nightmarish surrealism. The vibrant greenery seemed to wane, yielding to a palette of muted grays and disturbing hues of deep red. The usual melody of the forest - a symphony of bird songs, the rustling of leaves, and the distant gurgling of brooks - was gradually replaced by an unsettling, rhythmic hum, the eeriness of which seemed to echo in the very marrow of their bones. As they advanced, they witnessed how once robust trunks were now gnarled and twisted, their branches reaching out like skeletal hands yearning for salvation from the enveloping darkness."

            story= _ "The world around them grew dimmer, the sunlight suffocated by the sinister transformation of the foliage above. The air turned chill, the once-familiar forest scents of loam and leaf rot overtaken by a metallic tang, almost like the aftertaste of fear. The forest was evolving, or rather devolving, into a grotesque landscape that bore an uncanny resemblance to Kalgor's haunting nightmares."

            background=108_evil_forest.png
            story= _ "Shadows danced in the corner of their eyes, the eerie silence was occasionally punctuated by the distant crackling of a twig, sending a wave of goosebumps down their spines. Every instinct screamed at them to turn back, but the resolve in Kalgor's eyes was unwavering. The trepidation they felt was palpable, but the anticipation of the impending confrontation was even more overwhelming, binding them to their path. They ventured forth, the impending doom looming ever larger in their path, ready to face whatever malevolent power Voldur held over the forest."
