This peaceful tribe thrived on unity, a far cry from the brutal reputation orcs generally bore."

He yearned to explore the realms beyond the confines of his tribe's territory, but his innocent curiosity was yet to experience the harsh realities of the wider world."

His tribe lay in ruins. The village that was once filled with laughter and camaraderie was now consumed by smoke and the stench of blood. His tribe had been brutally slaughtered. His peaceful world had shattered, and he stood amid its remnants, filled with a fiery vengeance."
