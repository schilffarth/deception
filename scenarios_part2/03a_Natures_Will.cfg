The towering trees stretched skywards, their foliage glinting in hues of emerald and jade under the morning light, the age-old guardians of Elvish territory. The air buzzed with the faint harmony of natureâ€” distant birdsong, rustling leaves, and the serene murmur of the nearby river. The earth under their feet bore the scent of life and the echo of countless seasons."
