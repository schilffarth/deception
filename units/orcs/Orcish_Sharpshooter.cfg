    description= _ "An ingenious adaptation of the traditional crossbow gives birth to the 'Sharpshooter Crossbow', a highly sophisticated piece of weaponry that is delicately balanced for extreme accuracy, and often equipped with a recurve limb design, launching the arrow with exceptional velocity. This kind of device requires a great deal of skill to master, and significantly surpasses the performance of a typical orcish crossbow; crafting it, however, is also beyond ordinary orcish capabilities.

Orcs cherish any such weapons they manage to obtain, and without fail, they end up in the possession of their most proficient and perceptive archers. These 'Sharpshooters', as they are known, can pick off enemies from great distances, instilling fear in the hearts of those who dare to oppose them."
